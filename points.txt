Session:- 
Your blog app uses Django's session framework to store information about posts that users want to save for later. This is done without requiring a login, as sessions work by storing data on the server and associating it with a unique session ID stored in the user's browser cookies.
How it Works

1) User Clicks "Read Later" on a Post

I   When a user clicks the "Read Later" button, a POST request is sent to the ReadLaterView class.
II  The view checks if a session variable called "stored_posts" exists.
III If it doesn’t exist, it creates an empty list to store post IDs.
IV  The post's ID is added to this list, and the list is saved in the session (request.session['stored_posts']).

2) User Removes a Post from "Read Later"

I  If the post is already in the session, clicking "Read Later" again will remove it from the stored list.
II The updated list is then saved back into the session.

3) Retrieving Saved Posts

I   When the user visits the "Stored Posts" page, the app checks if there are any saved post IDs in the session.
II  If there are saved posts, it fetches them from the database and displays them.
III If no posts are saved, it shows a message saying "You didn't save any posts!"

Key Points
I   Sessions are used without requiring login (data is stored using browser cookies).
II  Saved post IDs are stored in the session under "stored_posts".
III Clicking "Read Later" adds or removes posts from the session list.
IV  Posts stored in the session are fetched and displayed when visiting the "Stored Posts" page.


** ModelForm (Django's forms.ModelForm)
It is directly linked to a Django model.
Fields are automatically generated based on the model fields.
Makes it easy to create forms for database records with minimal code.
Automatically includes model-level validation.


****************************************************************************************
1. Model (M) – Data Handling
The models.py file defines the database structure for your blog:

Post model stores blog posts with fields like title, content, slug, date, and author.
Comment model handles user comments linked to posts.
Tag and Author models define relationships for post categorization and authorship.
These models interact with the database to store and retrieve data.

2. View (V) – Business Logic
The views.py file contains class-based views (ListView and View) that control data flow:

StartingPage retrieves the latest three posts for the homepage.
AllPostView fetches all posts for the posts page.
SinglePostView retrieves a specific post by its slug and manages comments.
ReadLaterView handles session-based storage for saved posts (Read Later feature).
These views fetch data from models and pass it to templates for rendering.

3. Template (T) – User Interface
The HTML templates (e.g., index.html, all-posts.html, post-detail.html, stored-posts.html) display data dynamically:

The homepage (index.html) shows the latest three posts.
The posts page (all-posts.html) lists all blog posts.
The post detail page (post-detail.html) displays a single post, its tags, and comments.
The saved posts page (stored-posts.html) lists the user's saved posts.
These templates use Django’s template tags ({% for %}, {% if %}) to render dynamic content.
How It Works Together:
User Requests a Page: The URL pattern in urls.py maps the request to the appropriate view.
View Fetches Data: The view retrieves relevant data from the model.
View Passes Data to Template: The view sends the data as a context dictionary to the template.
Template Displays Data: The template dynamically renders the content and presents it to the user

************************************************************************************************

Yes, your project includes some CRUD operations, though not all are explicitly implemented in the views:

Create (C) - Adding Comments:

Users can submit comments on a post using the comment form in the SinglePostView.
The comment is saved to the database when the form is submitted and validated.
Read (R) - Viewing Posts and Comments:

Users can read all posts on the All Posts page.
The homepage displays the latest three posts.
Users can view individual posts along with their comments on the post detail page.
The "Read Later" page allows users to view their saved posts.
Update (U) - Editing Saved Posts List (Session-based):

Users can add or remove posts from their "Read Later" list.
This modifies the session data but does not update the database itself.
Delete (D) - Removing Saved Posts:

Users can remove posts from their "Read Later" list.
This is done by updating session storage rather than deleting from the database.
Missing Operations:
Create, Update, and Delete for Posts: Users cannot create, edit, or delete blog posts (only admins can do this through the Django Admin panel).

Edit or Delete Comments: Users cannot modify or delete their comments.
So, while your project includes some CRUD functionality, it primarily focuses on reading posts and adding comments, with limited update and delete actions.
